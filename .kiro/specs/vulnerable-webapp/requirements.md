# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for building a deliberately vulnerable web application designed for cybersecurity education and penetration testing practice. The project serves as a practical learning vehicle to understand web application security from both defensive and offensive perspectives, following industry-standard penetration testing methodologies and secure development practices.

The application will be a Task Management system that includes user authentication, CRUD operations, and data persistence, with intentionally introduced security vulnerabilities for educational exploitation and subsequent remediation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cybersecurity student, I want to build a professional-grade full-stack Task Management application with modern technology stack, so that I have a realistic enterprise-level application for security testing and learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is accessed THEN the system SHALL display a React.js frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. WHEN users interact with the interface THEN the system SHALL communicate with a Node.js Express backend API
3. WHEN data operations occur THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
4. WHEN the application is containerized THEN the system SHALL run in Docker containers for consistent environments
5. WHEN API documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security learner, I want comprehensive user authentication and session management functionality, so that I can explore various authentication and authorization vulnerabilities in a realistic system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new users register THEN the system SHALL create accounts with email verification
2. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL use JWT-based session management
3. WHEN sessions are managed THEN the system SHALL implement token refresh mechanisms
4. WHEN users access protected resources THEN the system SHALL verify authentication status
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error responses
6. WHEN users log out THEN the system SHALL invalidate active sessions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want comprehensive task management capabilities with advanced features, so that I can organize and track my work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users view their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display tasks with filtering and sorting options
2. WHEN users create tasks THEN the system SHALL save them with title, description, priority, and due dates
3. WHEN users update tasks THEN the system SHALL modify properties including status and priority
4. WHEN users delete tasks THEN the system SHALL remove them with confirmation prompts
5. WHEN users add comments THEN the system SHALL store and display task-related discussions
6. WHEN users search tasks THEN the system SHALL provide text-based search functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security student, I want the application to contain SQL injection vulnerabilities (CWE-89), so that I can learn how these critical attacks work and practice exploitation techniques.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN task search functionality is implemented THEN the system SHALL use raw SQL queries without parameterization
2. WHEN malicious SQL payloads are injected THEN the system SHALL execute the injected database commands
3. WHEN SQLMap tools are used THEN the system SHALL be successfully exploitable for data extraction
4. WHEN union-based attacks are attempted THEN the system SHALL allow database schema enumeration
5. WHEN the vulnerability is documented THEN the system SHALL include detailed comments explaining the security flaw

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security learner, I want the application to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks (CWE-79), so that I can understand how malicious scripts execute and practice XSS exploitation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN task comments are displayed THEN the system SHALL render unsanitized HTML content using dangerouslySetInnerHTML
2. WHEN malicious JavaScript is submitted in comments THEN the system SHALL execute scripts in other users' browsers
3. WHEN XSS payloads are tested THEN the system SHALL demonstrate successful script execution and DOM manipulation
4. WHEN stored XSS attacks are performed THEN the system SHALL persist malicious scripts in the database
5. WHEN the vulnerability is documented THEN the system SHALL include detailed comments explaining the XSS flaw

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security student, I want authentication and authorization flaws (CWE-287, CWE-384) in the application, so that I can learn about access control vulnerabilities and session management weaknesses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN task access is implemented THEN the system SHALL allow Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) without ownership verification
2. WHEN JWT tokens are managed THEN the system SHALL store them in localStorage instead of secure httpOnly cookies
3. WHEN session handling is implemented THEN the system SHALL lack proper token refresh and expiration mechanisms
4. WHEN authorization checks are performed THEN the system SHALL allow users to access other users' tasks via URL manipulation
5. WHEN the vulnerability is documented THEN the system SHALL include detailed comments explaining the access control flaws

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security learner, I want to systematically exploit the vulnerabilities using industry-standard tools, so that I can understand the attacker's perspective and methodology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SQL injection testing is performed THEN the system SHALL be exploitable using SQLMap for automated data extraction
2. WHEN XSS testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL allow successful payload execution using Burp Suite
3. WHEN authorization testing is performed THEN the system SHALL allow unauthorized access through direct object reference manipulation
4. WHEN penetration testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL be scannable using OWASP ZAP for vulnerability identification
5. WHEN exploitation is documented THEN the system SHALL capture screenshots and detailed attack methodologies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security student, I want comprehensive documentation of vulnerability remediation and secure coding practices, so that I can learn how to properly secure web applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SQL injection fixes are documented THEN the system SHALL provide parameterized query examples using Prisma ORM
2. WHEN XSS prevention is explained THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proper output encoding and CSP implementation
3. WHEN access control fixes are documented THEN the system SHALL show proper authorization checks and secure session management
4. WHEN security hardening is implemented THEN the system SHALL include security headers using Helmet.js middleware
5. WHEN the learning process is complete THEN the system SHALL include a comprehensive security assessment report

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a cybersecurity educator, I want the application to include comprehensive testing and documentation frameworks, so that it can serve as a complete educational resource.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vulnerability assessment is performed THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports with CVSS scoring
2. WHEN penetration testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL follow OWASP Testing Guide methodologies
3. WHEN educational materials are created THEN the system SHALL include step-by-step exploitation tutorials
4. WHEN remediation is taught THEN the system SHALL provide before-and-after code comparisons
5. WHEN compliance is verified THEN the system SHALL align with OWASP Top 10 2021 standards

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want the application to meet professional development standards and performance requirements, so that it represents realistic enterprise application architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API responses are measured THEN the system SHALL respond within 200ms for 95% of requests
2. WHEN concurrent users access the system THEN the system SHALL support 100 simultaneous users without degradation
3. WHEN code quality is evaluated THEN the system SHALL meet ESLint and Prettier standards
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL use proper environment variable management and security configurations
5. WHEN scalability is considered THEN the system SHALL implement stateless design patterns for horizontal scaling
