# Vulnerability Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for each vulnerability type implemented in the Vulnerable Task Management Application. Each vulnerability is documented with detailed explanations, exploitation techniques, real-world examples, and business impact assessments.

## Vulnerability Types Covered

1. [SQL Injection (CWE-89)](./sql-injection.md)
2. [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)](./xss.md)
3. [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (CWE-639)](./idor.md)
4. [Insecure Session Management (CWE-384)](./session-management.md)
5. [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) & Local File Inclusion (CWE-918, CWE-22)](./ssrf-lfi.md)

## Comprehensive Analysis Documents

### [Business Impact Assessment](./business-impact-assessment.md)
Comprehensive framework for quantifying financial, operational, and strategic risks associated with web application vulnerabilities. Includes:
- Industry-specific impact calculations
- ROI analysis for security investments
- Regulatory compliance cost models
- Real-world breach case studies with financial analysis

### [Exploitation Tutorials](./exploitation-tutorials.md)
Step-by-step tutorials for understanding attack methodologies in controlled environments. Features:
- Automated vulnerability discovery scripts
- Manual testing techniques and validation
- Advanced exploitation frameworks
- Professional tool integration (SQLMap, Burp Suite, Selenium)
- Multi-phase attack scenarios with code examples

## Documentation Structure

Each vulnerability documentation includes:

- **Overview**: What the vulnerability is and why it matters
- **Technical Details**: How the vulnerability works at a technical level
- **Exploitation Techniques**: Step-by-step attack methods
- **Real-World Examples**: Historical incidents and case studies
- **Business Impact**: Risk assessment and potential consequences
- **Detection Methods**: How to identify the vulnerability
- **Prevention Strategies**: Secure coding practices and mitigation techniques
- **Testing Procedures**: How to test for the vulnerability

## Learning Path

For optimal learning, we recommend following this sequence:

1. Start with **SQL Injection** - fundamental database security
2. Move to **XSS** - client-side security basics
3. Learn **IDOR** - authorization and access control
4. Study **Session Management** - authentication security
5. Finish with **SSRF/LFI** - advanced server-side attacks

## Risk Assessment Framework

All vulnerabilities are assessed using:

- **CVSS v3.1 Scoring**: Industry-standard vulnerability scoring
- **OWASP Risk Rating**: Business risk assessment methodology
- **Real-World Impact**: Actual breach examples and consequences
- **Exploitation Difficulty**: Technical skill required for attacks

## Compliance and Standards

This documentation aligns with:

- OWASP Top 10 2021
- CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 27001 Security Controls
